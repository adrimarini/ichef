# iCHEF
 Welcome to iChef! A place where you can
 organize your recipes and add photo's
 to inspire yourself for the next time you
 make each recipe!

### Technologies used
 Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap


### Approach Taken
Began with a wireframe, trello, ERD, and git hub repository.
Then created a rails file and started coding the actual app itself.

### Installation/ Start up instructions
Click on the url shown above, and Sign up for an account with iCHEF.
You will then be prompted to "Add a Board" to your Cook Book, and you
can start creating a collage of boards to represent your recipes!

### Next Steps
To further expand on this app, I would like to add a hover effect on the
main 'Cook Book' page that displays the name of the food. I would also like to
eventually make the users able to see each other and re-pin each others boards to
their own Cook Book.
